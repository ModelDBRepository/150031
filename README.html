Grid cell model
===============

This archive contains a spiking continuous attractor model of grid cells found
in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of rodents. It was used for modeling the
theta-nested gamma activity and grid firing fields in MEC and the results have
been published in [PASTOLL2013]_. The code in this archive reproduces parts of
the figures found in the published article.

For installation and prerequisites necessary to run the model see the
INSTALL.rst file in this directory.

20200306 Update from Ian Hawes:
I have uploaded a Dockerfile here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/4iar/bd25c175614419e2a92c591d74a8dc29">https://gist.github.com/4iar/bd25c175614419e2a92c591d74a8dc29</a>

Example steps to get a simulation running (I ran these commands on Ubuntu with Docker installed) :
1. Save the Dockerfile above into the GridCellModel folder
2. From the GridCellModel folder, build the Docker image:
    docker build . -t pastoll2013
3. From the GridCellModel folder, run a simulation:
    docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/code -w /code/grid_cell_model pastoll2013 ./submit_basic_grids.py


If you prefer not to use Docker, you can try copying the commands from the
Dockerfile into your terminal. I tested the environment on Ubuntu 14.04, but it
should work with other versions as long as you can get those python packages
installed.
